Figures created from the [merged data set](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/blob/main/OUTPUT/Merged_CovariateSet.csv) using [this script](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/blob/main/CODE/1_MergeAndSummarize_DataSets.R).

### Key Points


* Environmental covariates from the [DFO Fraser River Sockeye and Pink Forecast](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/tree/main/DATA/DFO_FraserSockeyeForecast) data set can be mostly reproduced from the source data links provided in the reports, and the source data sets go back much further than the available salmon spawner-recruit data sets (e.g., sea surface temperature and salinity records from British Columbia lighthouses are available since the early 1900s).

* Environmental covariates from the [NOAA Ocean Conditions Index](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/tree/main/DATA/NOAA_OceanConditionsIndex) data set can be downloaded directly and all start in 1998.

* The [Chasco et al. 2021](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/tree/main/DATA/Chascoetal2021_SnakeRiverCk) paper on Snake River (Columbia) Chinook provides an archived version of the covariates via github, and includes active links to source data for most of the covariates. Some of the covariates have been recreated and updated, others are being extracted from the archived data set for now.

* See [Variable descriptions](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/blob/main/DATA/LookUp_VariableDescriptions.csv) table for details.

* All three data sets include a mix of covariates at different scales. All three include large-scale variables (e.g., Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and more regional variables (e.g., sea surface temperature for one or a few locations). The *DFO Fraser Forecasting* data set and the Chasco et al. (2021) paper also include local variables (Fraser River discharge, Columbia River flow and temperature).

* All three data sets include a variable to reflect Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), but the details of the variable definition differ. [This note](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/tree/main/NOTES/PDO_Comparison) is taking a closer look at the similarities and differences.
