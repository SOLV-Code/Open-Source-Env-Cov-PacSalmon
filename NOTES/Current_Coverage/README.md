### Key Points


* Environmental covariates from the [DFO Fraser River Sockeye and Pink Forecast](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/tree/main/DATA/DFO_FraserSockeyeForecast) data set can be mostly reproduced from the source data links provided in the reports, and the source data sets go back much further than the available salmon spawner-recruit data sets (e.g., sea surface temperature and salinity records from British Columbia lighthouses are available since the early 1900s).

* Environmental covariates from the [NOAA Ocean Conditions Index](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/tree/main/DATA/NOAA_OceanConditionsIndex) data set can be downloaded directly and all start in 1998.

* See [Variable descriptions](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/blob/main/DATA/LookUp_VariableDescriptions.csv) table for details.

* Both the *DFO Fraser Forecasting* and *NOAA Ocean Conditions Index* data sets include a mix of large-scale variables (e.g., Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and more regional variables (e.g., sea surface temperature for one or a few locations). The *DFO Fraser Forecasting* data set also includes local variables (Fraser River discharge).

* Both the *DFO Fraser Forecasting* and *NOAA Ocean Conditions Index* include a variable to reflect Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) over the winter months, but the details of the variable definition differ. [This note](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/tree/main/NOTES/PDO_Comparison) is taking a closer look at the similarities and differences.
