## NOTES

Each folder includes a stand-alone note on a particular topic. The note are designed for collaborative editing. In each folder, the *README.md* is a [github-flavored markdown] document, which gets converted into a simple formatted page. You can edit these directly in your browser: Just click the pencil icon above (must be logged into GitHub). If you have a question or comment, rather than a specific edit, just start a [new issue](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/issues) to kick off the discussion.

Notes in progress:

* [Summary of current coverage](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/tree/main/NOTES/Current_Coverage) has an inventory of environmental covariates extracted from the data sets so far.

* [Comparison of PDO covariates](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/tree/main/NOTES/PDO_Comparison) takes a closer look at the alternative versions used in different applications.
