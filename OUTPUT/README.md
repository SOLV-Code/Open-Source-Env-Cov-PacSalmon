## OUTPUT

Files in this folder are generated from the [DATA](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/tree/main/DATA) folder using the R scripts in [CODE](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/tree/main/CODE).


Given the file structure in [DATA](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/tree/main/DATA), the R code to merge, cross-check, and summarize the data across projects is relatively simple.


### Contents
