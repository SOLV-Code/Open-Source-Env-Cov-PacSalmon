## DFO PACEA PACKAGE

**Status**: In progress

**Maintained by**: This entry maintained by [@SOLV-Code](https://github.com/SOLV-Code). Official version of the data set maintained the ```pbs-assess``` team in the [pacea package repository](https://github.com/pbs-assess/pacea).

**Last Data Update**: 2024-05-11

### Introduction

* R package

### Status of Data Set

* just starting with package install and exploration. See [this script](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/blob/main/CODE/DFO_PACEA_Package/1_Pacea_PackageInstallandDataExtract.R)


* some series updated monthly, some annually
* new series being added as papers are being written (e.g.: state of the pacific ocean reports)


Each data set is fully documented with links to raw data, data processing code, and detailed description of the data and context in a help file. If you use R and have the ```pacea``` package installed, you can access this information for each data set within R with ```help(object_name)``` or ```?object_name``` (e.g., ```?pdo```). If you are not accessing these data from within R, you can get the raw version of the help file in the package repository [man folder](https://github.com/pbs-assess/pacea/tree/main/man).
