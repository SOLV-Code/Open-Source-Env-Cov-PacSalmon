## NOAA Ocean Conditions Index

The NOAA ocean conditions and stoplight are developed for stocks that migrate into the California Current system, and very specific to CN and CO (CN and CO are indicators on their stoplight as a result) so won’t apply broadly to most Canadian stocks since most do not enter the California Current. At the time I spoke with the late Bill Peterson who developed these, now Brian Burke I think, and they sample juvenile salmon in the ocean off the coast, and ocean conditions, and built relationships b/w variables used and salmon responses. So they can isolate marine mechanisms since they sample juveniles in the ocean and can relate variables to marine survival. For our stocks, we largely cannot isolate marine survival for most, so have to consider both freshwater environmental variables and marine. Here’s a link to an old presentation: https://meetings.pices.int/publications/presentations/PICES_15/Ann15_S1/S1_Casillas-Peterson.pdf  and a paper: https://meridian.allenpress.com/jfwm/article-supplement/138759/pdf/10_3996_042010-jfwm-009_s6/   (dig around for papers by Bill Peterson and Brian Burke as there will be more that look at correlations b/w variables and their stocks
