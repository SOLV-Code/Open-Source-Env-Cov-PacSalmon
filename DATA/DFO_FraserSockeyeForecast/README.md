## DFO Fraser Sockeye and Pink Salmon Adult Run Size Forecast

**Status**: In progress

**Maintained by**: This entry maintained by [@SOLV-Code](https://github.com/SOLV-Code). Official version of the data set maintained by DFO Stock Assessment - Lower Fraser.

**Last Update**: 2014-02-12

### Introduction

Run size forecasts for stocks of Fraser River sockeye are developed annually, using a comprehensive suite of candidate models and extensive retrospective evaluation. Environmental covariates considered include local river conditions during juvenile outmigration, regional conditions during ocean entry, and large-scale climate conditions during the winter preceding outmigration.

Candidate models and forecast evaluation methods have evolved over more than 20 years through an intensive annual peer-review process.

Key milestones in the evolution of forecasting methods were: 

* [2010 Forecast](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/341025.pdf), which expanded the analyses and communication of uncertainty in the forecasts and formalized the consideration and testing of environmental covariates
* [2016 Forecast](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/365999.pdf) which first included a detailed discussion of environmental and other considerations by life history stage, packaged as a stand-alone [supplement document](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/4062254x.pdf). The supplement covered topics like adult migration conditions, spawner condition, spawner success, egg-to-fry survival, freshwater rearing conditions, juvenile migration timing, and juvenile diets at ocean entry. This supplemental information was included as an appendix in the main forecast report in subesequent years.

As the forecast methods have matured and stabilized, the peer-review process has changed as well. For 2000-2013, the annual forecasts were published as DFO Research Documents, which undergo a full peer-review coordinated by [DFO's Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/process-processus/srp-prs-eng.htm). From 2014 to 2021, a more streamlined [Science Response](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/process-processus/srp-prs-eng.htm) process was used. The full set of reports is available through the [References](#References) below.



### Status of Data Set

Most of the source data can be accessed through links in the latest report, but the final time series actually being used is not currently available online. 
It is, however, available upon request from the [DFO Lower Fraser Office](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/contact/regions/pacific-pacifique-eng.html#Delta). 

The source data used to generate the specific environmental covariate time series described in detail in the reports. The most recent report includes active links to online source data for the PDO variable as well as the raw sea surface temperature and salinity data. For the Fraser River discharge data, an agency contact is provided.  

The reports include plots of the environmental covariate time series (e.g., Figures 3-5 of the [2021 Forecast](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/41006057.pdf)), but do not include a table with the actual annual values. Recent forecast reports also include detailed discussion of environmental conditions in a supplemental appendix (e.g., Appendix A5 of the [2021 Forecast](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/41006057.pdf)).

For this repository, we are trying to replicate the data treatment steps to generate [up-to-date covariate time series](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/blob/main/DATA/DFO_FraserSockeyeForecast/GENERATED_COVARS_DFOFraserRiverForecasts.csv) directly from the publicly available source data. *This is still a work in progress, as we are checking the generated file against to official data set*.

### Details

**PDO Pacific Decadal Oscillation**

The latest forecast report provides 
[this link](http://research.jisao.washington.edu/pdo/PDO.latest) for the PDO index. The source file includes brief notes on the data and citations with more detail. 

The source file describes the data set as *"Updated standardized values for the PDO index, derived as the leading PC of monthly SST anomalies in the North Pacific Ocean,  poleward of 20N. The monthly mean global average SST anomalies are removed to separate this pattern of variability from any "global warming" signal that may be present in the data."* 

*Note*: This source file ends in 2018. Another version that goes up to 2022 with matching values is available [here](https://psl.noaa.gov/gcos_wgsp/Timeseries/Data/pdo.long.data), but does not include the context and definitions. Up-to-date versions are available online, but numbers don't match (e.g., [here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/cmb/ersst/v5/index/ersst.v5.pdo.dat)).

The online source file is in text format with text and annotations, so values can't be extracted easily. We manually generate source files matching the [data structure for this repository](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/tree/main/DATA) from the notes [here](http://research.jisao.washington.edu/pdo/PDO.latest)  and the values [here](https://psl.noaa.gov/gcos_wgsp/Timeseries/Data/pdo.long.data). To get the values, copy just the tab-separated values into a text file and add column headers (like like [this](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/blob/main/DATA/DFO_FraserSockeyeForecast/RawFiles/PDOIdxSource_DataRaw.txt)), import into Excel, and then copy values into the [csv](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/blob/main/DATA/DFO_FraserSockeyeForecast/PDOIdxSource_Data.csv).

[This R script](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/blob/main/CODE/DFO_FraserSockeyeForecast/1_Process_Source_Data.R) then reorganizes the raw data and calculates Nov-Mar means.


**Sea Surface Temperature and Salinity**

The latest forecast report provides 
[this link](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/719955f2-bf8e-44f7-bc26-6bd623e82884) to a complete set of sea surface temperature and salinity measurements at BC lightstation starting in 1914. There is also an [interactive map](https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/6140178915024068ac498da4225a2e6b) for exploring lightstation locations and associated data.

The actual data set is available online as a single [zip file (3MB)](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/719955f2-bf8e-44f7-bc26-6bd623e82884/resource/472ebc80-bcc4-4926-8aad-7b0662532b84) with all the data, organized into subfolders. To get the values, manually extract the monthly average sea surface temperature and salinity files for Entrance Island, Pine Island, Amphitrite Point, Race Rocks, and Departure Bay. Departure Bay measurements are used to fill in missing values in the Entrance Island data (p.6 of [2021 Forecast](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/41006057.pdf)).

[This R script](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/blob/main/CODE/DFO_FraserSockeyeForecast/1_Process_Source_Data.R) extracts and merges the raw data, then calculates Apr-Jun mean for SST, Jul-Aug and Jul-Sep mean for SSS).
