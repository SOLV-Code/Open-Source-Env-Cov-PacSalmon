1. Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO): a broad index of sea surface temperature (SST) in the
North Pacific (Mantua et al. 1997); http://jisao.washington.edu/pdo/PDO.latest
2. Sea-Surface-Temperature (SST): data were sampled at lighthouse locations that are
thought to best represent conditions experienced by juveniles during their initial stages of
migration in the marine environment in the juvenile ocean entry year. The two locations are
Entrance Island (Strait of Georgia, proximate to Nanaimo) and Pine Island (NE corner of
Vancouver Island).

A. Entrance Island: average SST data (April to June) in the Strait of Georgia where
juvenile Fraser Sockeye first enter the marine environment.

B. Sea-Surface-Temperature (SST) Pine Island: average SST data (April to July) on
the northern tip of Vancouver Island (see previous web link).
4. Fraser discharge (peak and average April to June mean discharge):
