## DFO Fraser Sockeye Forecast

### Introduction

Run size forecasts for stocks of Fraser River sockeye are developed annually, using a comprehensive suite of candidate models and extensive retrospective evaluation. Environmental covariates considered include river conditions during juvenile outmigration, local conditions during ocean entry, and large-scale ocean conditions during the winter preceding outmigration.

Candidate models and forecast evaluation methods have evolved over more than 20 years through an intensive annual peer-review process. A key milestone in the evolution of forecasting methods was the 
[2010 Forecast](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/341025.pdf), which expanded the analyses and communication of uncertainty in the forecasts and formalized the consideration and testing of environmental covariates.

As the forecast methods have matured and stabilized, the peer-review process has changed as well. From 2000 to 2012, the annual forecasts were published as DFO Research Documents, which undergo a full peer-review coordinated by [DFO's Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/process-processus/srp-prs-eng.htm). From 2014 to 2021, a more streamlined [Science Response](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/process-processus/srp-prs-eng.htm) process was used. The full set of reports is available through the [References](#References) below.



### Status of Data Set

The source data used to generate the specific environmental covariate time series described in detail in the reports, and the most recent report includes

detailed discussion of environmental conditions in a supplemental appendix (e.g., Appendix A5 of the [2021 Forecast](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/41006057.pdf)

plots of the time series (e.g., 

but the reports do not include a table with the actual annual values for the environmental covariate time series.

For this repository, we are trying to replicate the data treatment steps to generate up-to-date covariate time series directly from the publicly available source data. *This is still a work in progress*.

### Questions

* 2013, 2022, 2023 forecast papers not published?
* Other than the big 2010 overhaul, any years with substantial changes to the methods?
*

North Pacific (Mantua et al. 1997); http://jisao.washington.edu/pdo/PDO.latest
2. Sea-Surface-Temperature (SST): data were sampled at lighthouse locations that are
thought to best represent conditions experienced by juveniles during their initial stages of
migration in the marine environment in the juvenile ocean entry year. The two locations are
Entrance Island (Strait of Georgia, proximate to Nanaimo) and Pine Island (NE corner of
Vancouver Island).

A. Entrance Island: average SST data (April to June) in the Strait of Georgia where
juvenile Fraser Sockeye first enter the marine environment.
