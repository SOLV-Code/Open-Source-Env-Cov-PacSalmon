## DFO Fraser Sockeye and Pink Salmon Adult Run Size Forecast

**Status**: In progress

**Maintained by**: This entry maintained by [@SOLV-Code](https://github.com/SOLV-Code). Official version of the data set maintained by DFO Stock Assessment - Lower Fraser.

**Last Update**: 2014-02-12

### Introduction

Run size forecasts for stocks of Fraser River sockeye are developed annually, using a comprehensive suite of candidate models and extensive retrospective evaluation. Environmental covariates considered include local river conditions during juvenile outmigration, regional conditions during ocean entry, and large-scale climate conditions during the winter preceding outmigration.

Candidate models and forecast evaluation methods have evolved over more than 20 years through an intensive annual peer-review process.

Key milestones in the evolution of forecasting methods were: 

* [2010 Forecast](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/341025.pdf), which expanded the analyses and communication of uncertainty in the forecasts and formalized the consideration and testing of environmental covariates
* [2016 Forecast](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/365999.pdf) which first included a detailed discussion of environmental and other considerations by life history stage, packaged as a stand-alone [supplement document](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/4062254x.pdf). The supplement covered topics like adult migration conditions, spawner condition, spawner success, egg-to-fry survival, freshwater rearing conditions, juvenile migration timing, and juvenile diets at ocean entry. This supplemental information was included as an appendix in the main forecast report in subesequent years.

As the forecast methods have matured and stabilized, the peer-review process has changed as well. For 2000-2013, the annual forecasts were published as DFO Research Documents, which undergo a full peer-review coordinated by [DFO's Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/process-processus/srp-prs-eng.htm). From 2014 to 2021, a more streamlined [Science Response](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/process-processus/srp-prs-eng.htm) process was used. The full set of reports is available through the [References](#References) below.



### Status of Data Set

Most of the source data can be accessed through links in the latest report, but the final time series actually being used is not currently available online. 
It is, however, available upon request from the [DFO Lower Fraser Office](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/contact/regions/pacific-pacifique-eng.html#Delta). 

The source data used to generate the specific environmental covariate time series described in detail in the reports. The most recent report includes active links to online source data for the PDO variable as well as the raw sea surface temperature and salinity data. For the Fraser River discharge data, an agency contact is provided.  

The reports include plots of the environmental covariate time series (e.g., Figures 3-5 of the [2021 Forecast](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/41006057.pdf)), but do not include a table with the actual annual values. Recent forecast reports also include detailed discussion of environmental conditions in a supplemental appendix (e.g., Appendix A5 of the [2021 Forecast](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/41006057.pdf)).

For this repository, we are trying to replicate the data treatment steps to generate up-to-date covariate time series directly from the publicly available source data. *This is still a work in progress*.


### Questions to Resolve

* 2019, 2020, 2022, 2023 forecast papers not published?
* Other than the 2010 and 2016 milestones listed above, any years with substantial changes to the methods that should be highlighted?
* Why does the PDO source data [here](http://research.jisao.washington.edu/pdo/PDO.latest) end in Sep 2018? Another source [here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/cmb/ersst/v5/index/ersst.v5.pdo.dat) goes to Jan 2024, but has different values than the source provided in the 2021 FC paper.
* The PDO index [source file](http://research.jisao.washington.edu/pdo/PDO.latest) states that the underlying warming trend has been removed from the index to focus on anomalies. For the purpose of salmon forecasting, should the isolated warming index be included as a stand-alone environmental covariate?

### Details

**PDO Pacific Decadal Oscillation**

The latest forecast report provides 
[this link](http://research.jisao.washington.edu/pdo/PDO.latest) for the PDO index. The source file includes brief notes on the data and citations with more detail. 

The source file describes the data set as *"Updated standardized values for the PDO index, derived as the leading PC of monthly SST anomalies in the North Pacific Ocean,  poleward of 20N. The monthly mean global average SST anomalies are removed to separate this pattern of variability from any "global warming" signal that may be present in the data."* 

*Note*: This source file ends in 2018. Another version that goes up to 2022 with matching values is available [here](https://psl.noaa.gov/gcos_wgsp/Timeseries/Data/pdo.long.data), but does not include the context and definitions. Up-to-date versions are available online, but numbers don't match (e.g., [here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/cmb/ersst/v5/index/ersst.v5.pdo.dat)).

The online source file is in text format with text and annotations, so values can't be extracted easily. We manually generate source files matching the [data structure for this repository](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/tree/main/DATA) from the notes [here](http://research.jisao.washington.edu/pdo/PDO.latest)  and the values [here](https://psl.noaa.gov/gcos_wgsp/Timeseries/Data/pdo.long.data). To get the values, copy just the tab-separated values into a text file, add column headers, import into Excel, and then copy values into the csv.
