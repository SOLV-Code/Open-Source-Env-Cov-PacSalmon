## DFO Fraser Sockeye and Pink Salmon Adult Run Size Forecast

**Status**: In progress
**Maintained by**: This entry maintained by [@SOLV-Code](https://github.com/SOLV-Code). Official version of the data set maintained by DFO Stock Assessment - Lower Fraser.


### Introduction

Run size forecasts for stocks of Fraser River sockeye are developed annually, using a comprehensive suite of candidate models and extensive retrospective evaluation. Environmental covariates considered include local river conditions during juvenile outmigration, regional conditions during ocean entry, and large-scale climate conditions during the winter preceding outmigration.

Candidate models and forecast evaluation methods have evolved over more than 20 years through an intensive annual peer-review process.

Key milestones in the evolution of forecasting methods were: 

* [2010 Forecast](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/341025.pdf), which expanded the analyses and communication of uncertainty in the forecasts and formalized the consideration and testing of environmental covariates
* [2016 Forecast](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/365999.pdf) which first included a detailed discussion of environmental and other considerations by life history stage, packaged as a stand-alone [supplement document](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/4062254x.pdf). The supplement covered topics like adult migration conditions, spawner condition, spawner success, egg-to-fry survival, freshwater rearing conditions, juvenile migration timing, and juvenile diets at ocean entry. This supplemental information was included as an appendix in the main forecast report in subesequent years.

As the forecast methods have matured and stabilized, the peer-review process has changed as well. For 2000-2013, the annual forecasts were published as DFO Research Documents, which undergo a full peer-review coordinated by [DFO's Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/process-processus/srp-prs-eng.htm). From 2014 to 2021, a more streamlined [Science Response](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/process-processus/srp-prs-eng.htm) process was used. The full set of reports is available through the [References](#References) below.



### Status of Data Set

Most of the source data can be accessed through links in the latest report, but the final time series actually being used is not currently available online. 
It is, however, available upon request from the [DFO Lower Fraser Office](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/contact/regions/pacific-pacifique-eng.html#Delta). 

The source data used to generate the specific environmental covariate time series described in detail in the reports. The most recent report includes active links to online source data for the PDO variable as well as the raw sea surface temperature and salinity data. For the Fraser River discharge data, an agency contact is provided.  

The reports include plots of the environmental covariate time series (e.g., Figures 3-5 of the [2021 Forecast](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/41006057.pdf)), but do not include a table with the actual annual values. Recent forecast reports also include detailed discussion of environmental conditions in a supplemental appendix (e.g., Appendix A5 of the [2021 Forecast](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/41006057.pdf)).

For this repository, we are trying to replicate the data treatment steps to generate up-to-date covariate time series directly from the publicly available source data. *This is still a work in progress*.


### Questions to Resolve

* 2019, 2020, 2022, 2023 forecast papers not published?
* Other than the 2010 and 2016 milestones listed above, any years with substantial changes to the methods that should be highlighted?
