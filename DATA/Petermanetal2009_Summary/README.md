### Introduction

This paper covers a large-scale research effort, summarizing key results from multiple connected papers. The analysis focused on environmental covariates with long time series of data collected at numerous  locations.

The analysis covers 120 Pacific salmon populations from Washington state up through  western Alaska (37 sockeye 
salmon populations, 43 pink, and 40 chum), using spawner-recruit data from brood years 1948–1996 (average  of  31 
brood years of data per population, range from 15 to 47 years).

Environmental covariates covered *"three  features  of  coastal  ocean  conditions: upwelling,  sea-surface  temperature  (SST), 
and sea-surface salinity (SSS). We used measures  of  coastal  ocean  conditions  because considerable research suggests that much  of 
the between-year and between-decade variations  in  lifetime  survival  rates  of  the  three salmon  species  studied  here  occurs  during the  early  ocean  or  late  freshwater  life  stage  (although few data  are  available  for  the  later)"*.   




### Status of Data Set


The paper provides a link to the salmon data, but it is now inactive. 

For the environmental covariates, the paper cites Mueter (2002) and Mueter (2005), which provide detailed descriptions, excerpted below.

However, there is no table with the actual values or link to supplementary materials. Each of the covariates combines data
from multiple sources to construct an index of large-scale conditions, so trying to reproduce the calculations to generate an up-to-date version will require substantial effort.

### Details

Peterman et al. (2009): *"Monthly  up-welling indices from 1946 to 1998 were from 14  locations  along  the  west  coast  of  North 
America.  Data  for  monthly  SST  (from  22 coastal stations) and SSS (15 coastal stations)  covered various years in that  period,  but the most reliable SST  data  spanned  1951–1997. We used anomalies from  the station-speciﬁc monthly means for each variable to  account for latitudinal gradients  in  mean values."* 


**Sea Surface Temperature**

Mueter et al. (2005): *"We used two independent sources of coastal SST variability. First, monthly
averages of SST were obtained for 14 coastal stations in British Columbia and Alaska. Station locations, temporal coverage, and data sources are described in Mueter et al. (2002). The temporal extent of these data varied, but with the exception of several missing years, SST data at coastal stations were available for all years for which we had salmon data. Second, to extend the geographic coverage of SST data, we used monthly average of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) ‘‘Extended Reconstructed SST’’ (NOAA 2003). Reconstructed SST data (RecSST) were obtained for selected grid cells (2°latitude x 2°longitude) along the coasts of Washington, British Columbia, and Alaska. To limit data to coastal areas, we selected only grid cells with perimeters that intersected the coastline."*


**Sea Surface Salinity**

Mueter et al. (2005): *"As described in Mueter et al. (2002b), SSS data were available for nine stations in British Colum-
bia. Unfortunately, no long-term observations of salinity were available for any stations in Alaska. Thus, as a proxy of coastal salinities, we used an index of monthly anomalies of total freshwater discharge into the coastal Gulf of Alaska (Royer
et al. 2001; data provided by T. Royer, Old Dominion University, personal communication). The index is negatively correlated with salinities at a site located within the Alaska Coastal Current (ACC) off the Kenai Peninsula (59°50.7'N,149°28.0'W; Royer et al. 2001). To serve as a proxy for salinity, we reversed the sign of the discharge index."*



**Upwelling Indices**

Mueter et al. (2005): *"Monthly upwelling indices (Bakun 1990) from 1946 to present were obtained for six
locations off the coasts of British Columbia, southeast Alaska, and south-central Alaska from the Paciﬁc Fisheries Environmental Laboratory (NMFS 2003)."*
