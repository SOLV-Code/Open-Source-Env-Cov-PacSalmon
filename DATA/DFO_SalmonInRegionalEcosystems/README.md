### Introduction

DFO's *Salmon in Regional Ecosystems Program* (SiRE-P) investigates the mechanisms controlling recruitment variations and changes in productive capacity of salmon stocks within freshwater and/or marine ecosystems.
[plthompson](https://github.com/plthompson) and the [SiRE-P team](https://github.com/SiRE-P) are focusing their research on causal mechanisms linking environmental covariates to salmon population dynamics, rather than observed correlations or statistical criteria of predictive power (e.g., in retrospective evaluation of forecast performance). One tool they're using to scope analyses are *Directed Acyclic Graphs* (DAGs). For a brief introduction to DAGs, see our [Causal Inference wiki page](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/wiki/Causal-Inference).

### Status of Data Set

There is no published data from this research program yet, but the infrastructure for sharing both data and analyses is taking shape:
* Documentation for individual projects will be accessible through the [SiRE-P Github Main Page](https://github.com/SiRE-P).  
* Data and functions used across projects will be shared through the [SiREfunctions R Package](https://github.com/SiRE-P/SiREfunctions), taking a similar approach as the [pacea package](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/tree/main/DATA/DFO_PACEA_Package).
