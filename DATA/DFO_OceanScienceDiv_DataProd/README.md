### Introduction

The [data products site](https://ios-osd-dpg.github.io/) is an inventory of key data sets. It covers the following data sets:

* Line P Monitoring: data such as surface oxygen anomalies from long-term monitoring along a standard line from the BC coast into the Pacific
* BC Lightstation Sea-surface temperatures
* Ocean Sciences Division mooring data (sea surface temperature and salinity)
* Marine heatwave monitoring of the Northeast Pacific
* Deep water properties of B.C Inlets
* Satellite Sea-Surface Temperature and Chlorophyll-a Concentration Time Series


### Status of Data Set

This site is focused on providing brief descriptions and up-to-date summary graphs of oceanographic data, with links to raw data such as GIS layers with satellite data. Some of the links are broken.

Especially noteworthy is the material for marine heatwave monitoring, which links to a stand-alone github repository with  all the code used to process the raw data and detailed summary plots that are updated weekly.

Given the focus on oceanographic data products, this resource does not look at potential linkages to Pacific salmon models and does not provide time series that are directly usable as covariates. We are therefore not incorporating any specific data series from this source into the PSEC repository.

For example, their entry on the BC Lightstation sea-surface temperature data provides helpful background on the data set and includes detailed and up-to-date summary plots (climatologies, anomaly trends). By comparison, the [Fraser Sockeye and Pink forecasting](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/tree/main/DATA/DFO_FraserSockeyeForecast) data set includes processed annual time series from this raw data which have been used annually in forecasting models. See details there.
