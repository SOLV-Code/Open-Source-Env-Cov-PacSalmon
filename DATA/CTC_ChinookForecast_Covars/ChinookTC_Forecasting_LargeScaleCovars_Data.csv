# Large-Scale Environmental Covariates used in Chinook Forecasting by the Chinook Technical Committee (CTC) of the Pacific Salmon Commission,,,,,,,,,,,,
# CTC has an annual process to compile a covariate data set. This combines variables derived from public raw data and variables contributed by different agencies (DFO and NOAA),,,,,,,,,,,,
# To get the latest official version of these data: contact the CTC chairs via https://www.psc.org/membership-lists/,,,,,,,,,,,,
# Alternatively you can use the code in the covariates_forecastr repository to generate the data set (https://github.com/nembrown/covariates_forecastr),,,,,,,,,,,,
# THIS VERSION: ,,,,,,,,,,,,
# - Extracted from data file provided by CTC July 2024,,,,,,,,,,,,
# - Includes only large-scale covariates that match the same values to all stocks ,,,,,,,,,,,,
# - Excludes large-scale covariates that are taken from the NOAA ocean conditions index (https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/tree/main/DATA/NOAA_OceanConditionsIndex),,,,,,,,,,,,
# - Years are calendar years so need to be matched to stock-specific spawner-recruit data based on life history and assumed mechanism (e.g. ONI matched to brood year),,,,,,,,,,,,
# NOTE: some of these covariates are calculated from monthly indices extracted from the pacea package (https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/tree/main/DATA/DFO_PACEA_Package),,,,,,,,,,,,
