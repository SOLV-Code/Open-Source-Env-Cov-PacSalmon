### Introduction

### Status of Data Set

The covariate series used in the paper are available in a [github repository](https://github.com/bchasco/SAR_paper).

[Table 2](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0246659.t002) of the paper defines the covariates and provides links to source data. In the [pdf version](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0246659&type=printable) of the paper these links are clickable. 

With this information it should be possible to replicate the calculations, generate an up-to-date version of the data set, and cross-check the earlier years against the archived data set from the paper. *This is a work in progress and some challenges came up, which are being tracked at [this thread](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/issues/74)*
