## DFO State of the Pacific Ocean

**Status**: In Progress

**Maintained by**: This entry maintained by [@SOLV-Code](https://github.com/SOLV-Code), with contributions from XYZ. There is currently no official version of a data set from this report series.

**Last Data Update**: 2014-02-17

### Introduction

DFO convenes an annual meeting of the marine science community in the Pacific Region.  Participants present the results of the most recent yearâ€™s monitoring in the context of previous observations and expected future conditions.

These *State of the Pacific Ocean* (SOPO) meetings started in 1999. As ocean conditions have become increasingly variable and extreme events have become more frequent, the structure, content, and publication process for the annual reports has evolved considerably (see [Reference](#References) below).


### Status of Data Set

There isn't a single data set of key variables that can be extracted or recreated. Rather, key observations are discussed in stand-alone contributions.

Still need to figure which of the time series discussed in these report are within
scope for this repository, then figure out how to get them. 



### Open Questions 

* [Which variables to extract? And how to get them?](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/issues/65)
* [Link between State of Pacific Ocean Reports and forecasts](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon/issues/70)

### Highlights from Published Analyses

* To be included
